### Kaggle Notebook: Comprehensive Guide to Text Preprocessing with Python

Performing initial data investigation is the first step in every data science project. Examining the data helps us understand its structure, discover patterns, and evaluate data quality.

This is a starter notebook for natural language processing in text processing. It will show you how to summarize and visualize your textual data to gain valuable insights and understanding for your NLP project. It covers text preprocessing and analysis in comprehensive detail.

### Kaggle Competetion: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

<a href="[https://www.kaggle.com/code/afi1289/a-comprehensive-guide-to-text-preprocessing?scriptVersionId=113379465](https://www.kaggle.com/code/afi1289/nlp-with-disaster-tweets-cleaning-tf-idf-and-bert)" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="Kaggle" title="Open in Kaggle" src="https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg"></a>

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

### Kaggle Competition: Predict Ames House Price using Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost and LightGBM

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/ames-house-price.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/kaggle-house-price/blob/master/ames-house-price.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
